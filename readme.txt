Hello There!

My name is Noble Wilson and I am an aspiring IT/InfoSec coder practicing for my future.
_____________________________________________________________

The code here is very straight forward.

This project uses the following modules and libraries:
sys
socket
validators
pyfiglet
datetime

The beauty of this project is how terribly it runs. You call it a bug, I call it artistic.

Any suggestions or tips are greatly appreciated, and feel free to use this code for any safe purposes.
